Hi, I'm Priya. 
Welcome to my personal website where I pen my thoughts on what I learn.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

I have completed my Undergraduate in Computer Science from PEC University of Technology, Chandigarh. 
Currently, I work as a Backend Developer at Deutsche Bank. My work mostly revolves around building applications in Java and Spring Boot. Previously, I have worked as a Software Developer Intern at Cuemath where I built web apps using Django and ReactJS.

I am a core techie at heart. Whenever I get the opportunity to experiment I like to deep dive into the
best ways to make things work. I am always open to discussing about random tech thoughts and ideas, so feel free to hit me up.
